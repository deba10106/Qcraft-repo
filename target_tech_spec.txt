1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1.1.1 Brief Overview of the Project
QCraft represents a paradigm shift in quantum computing infrastructure,
delivering the first desktop-based, adaptive quantum compiler and error
correction platform specifically designed for fault-tolerant quantum
computing. The system addresses the critical transition point where
quantum computing companies have shifted from targeting physical qubits
to logical qubits, with every roadmap now including quantum error
correction. QCraft combines cutting-edge reinforcement learning
algorithms with graph neural networks to optimize quantum error
correction code placement and circuit compilation, while maintaining strict
privacy controls that ensure logical circuits never leave the user's desktop
environment.

1.1.2 Core Business Problem Being Solved
The quantum computing industry faces a fundamental challenge: quantum
error correction only provides exponential suppression of logical error rates
if the physical error rate is below a critical threshold. Current solutions
suffer from three critical limitations:
Resource Overhead Crisis: Traditional surface codes require nearly
3,000 qubits to protect 12 logical qubits for roughly a million cycles,
while advanced qLDPC codes can achieve the same protection with
only 288 qubits
Privacy and Security Concerns: Existing cloud-based quantum
compilation services expose sensitive logical circuit designs to external
systems

1.2 SYSTEM OVERVIEW
1.2.1 Project Context
Business Context and Market Positioning
2024 marked a turning point where quantum computing companies shifted
from targeting physical qubits to logical qubits, with companies predicting
deployment of real-time QEC capabilities by 2028 at the latest. QCraft
positions itself at the forefront of this transition, providing the essential
infrastructure needed for practical fault-tolerant quantum computing.
The quantum error correction landscape has experienced significant
breakthroughs in 2024, including Google's demonstration of belowthreshold surface code memories with a distance-7 code achieving 0.143%
± 0.003% error per cycle and IBM's Nature-published work on qLDPC codes
that perform as well as surface codes while requiring only one-tenth of the
qubits.

Current System Limitations
Existing quantum compilation and error correction solutions exhibit critical
deficiencies:
Cloud Dependency: Most current solutions require uploading logical
circuits to cloud services, creating security vulnerabilities
Static Optimization: Fixed heuristic approaches cannot adapt to
hardware-specific noise characteristics or learn from execution
feedback
Limited QEC Support: Most systems support only surface codes,
missing opportunities for more efficient qLDPC implementations
Scalability Constraints: Current methods rely on complex unscalable
neural networks such as transformers for circuit optimization

2025-09-22T11:19:15

5.1 HIGH-LEVEL ARCHITECTURE
5.1.1 System Overview
QCraft employs a layered desktop application architecture with clear
separation of concerns, designed specifically for privacy-preserving
quantum circuit compilation and error correction. The architecture follows
the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern enhanced with domainspecific layers for quantum computing operations.
The Qt ModelView architecture simplifies the linking and updating your UI
with data in custom formats or from external sources, making it ideal for
QCraft's complex quantum circuit representations and real-time
optimization feedback. The system adopts a plugin-based architecture
for quantum error correction families and hardware backends, ensuring
extensibility while maintaining strict privacy boundaries.
The architectural style emphasizes local-first processing with optional
cloud integration, ensuring that logical circuits never leave the user's
desktop environment. This design principle drives the entire system
architecture, from data flow patterns to component isolation strategies.
Key Architectural Principles:
Privacy by Design: All logical circuit processing occurs locally with
encrypted export only
Adaptive Learning: Continuous improvement through reinforcement
learning feedback loops
Hardware Agnostic: Unified abstraction layer supporting multiple
quantum platforms
Modular Extensibility: Plugin architecture for QEC families and
hardware backends
Configuration-Driven: YAML/JSON-based configuration with schema
validation

5.1.3 Data Flow Description

Built by Blitzy System 2 AI, 2025

Page 67 of 268

Qcraft

2025-09-22T11:19:15

The primary data flow follows a pipeline architecture with feedback
loops for continuous learning. Logical circuits enter through the PySide6
GUI and undergo a series of transformations: preprocessing → QEC family
selection → multi-patch mapping → fault-tolerant encoding → circuit
optimization → encrypted export.
Integration Patterns:
Event-Driven Communication: Qt signals/slots mechanism for realtime UI updates
Pipeline Processing: Sequential transformation of quantum circuits
through processing stages
Feedback Loops: RL agents receive execution results to improve
future optimizations
Configuration Injection: YAML-driven parameters injected at each
processing stage
Data Transformation Points:
Circuit Representation: Conversion between logical, intermediate,
and fault-tolerant representations
QEC Encoding: Transformation from logical to error-corrected
quantum circuits
Hardware Mapping: Adaptation of circuits to specific quantum
hardware topologies
Privacy Encoding: Encryption and obfuscation of circuits for external
execution
Key Data Stores:
Configuration Cache: YAML/JSON configurations with schema
validation
Results Database: SQLite storage for execution results and
performance metrics
Model Repository: PyTorch model checkpoints for RL agents
Circuit Library: JSON-based storage for quantum circuit definitions

Component Purpose and Scope:
The RL optimizer implements Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm,
employs Graph Neural Networks to approximate the policy and value
functions for quantum circuit optimization. After training on small
Clifford+T circuits of 5-qubits and few tenths of gates, the agent
consistently improves the state-of-the-art for this type of circuits, for at
least up to 80-qubit and 2100 gates.

6.1 CORE SERVICES ARCHITECTURE
6.1.1 Architecture Applicability Assessment
Core Services Architecture is not applicable for this system due to
the fundamental architectural design principles and requirements of
QCraft.
QCraft is designed as a desktop-based, modular monolithic
application rather than a distributed services architecture. This
architectural decision is driven by several critical factors:

6.1.4 Alternative Architecture
Considerations
Why Not Microservices?
Google identified five main challenges with microservices: Performance
overhead, correctness difficulties in distributed systems, and management
complexity of multiple applications. For QCraft's desktop application
context, these challenges outweigh the benefits:
Performance Impact: The overhead of serializing data and sending it
across the network has a noticeable impact on performance, which
conflicts with QCraft's sub-5-second compilation requirements.
Correctness Complexity: It's difficult to reason about correctness of a
distributed system when there are many interactions between
components, particularly problematic for quantum circuit optimization
where correctness is paramount.
Management Overhead: Managing multiple different applications, each
with its release schedule is inappropriate for a single-user desktop
application.

Modular Monolith Advantages
Modular monoliths provide high cohesion, low coupling, data
encapsulation, and focus on business functionalities, while microservices
add independent deployments and scalability that aren't needed for
desktop applications.

6.1.6 Scalability Through Modular Design
Vertical Scaling Approach
Modularizing the monolith with subdomains organized into vertical slices
consisting of presentation, business and persistent logic enables QCraft to
scale functionality without distributed systems complexity:
Module-Level Scaling:
Threading: Independent thread pools per module for parallel
processing
Resource Allocation: Dynamic memory and CPU allocation based on
module workload
Caching: Module-specific caching strategies optimized for each
domain
Processing Pipelines: Asynchronous processing within modules for
non-blocking operations

Future Migration Path
Having a modular architecture allows easy extraction of modules into
separate services when microservices become necessary. QCraft's modular
design provides a clear migration path if distributed deployment becomes
required in the future.

6.1.7 Operational Simplicity
Single Deployment Unit Benefits

Built by Blitzy System 2 AI, 2025

Page 112 of 268

Qcraft

2025-09-22T11:19:15

Monolithic advantages include easy deployment of one executable file,
simplified development with one code base, and better performance
through centralized APIs.
Deployment Characteristics:
Single Executable: Desktop application distributed as unified
package
No Service Discovery: Direct module references eliminate network
discovery overhead
Unified Configuration: Single configuration system across all
modules
Simplified Monitoring: Centralized logging and metrics collection

Development and Maintenance Advantages
Monolithic architecture simplifies development during early SDLC stages,
deployment through copying packaged application, and provides single
codebase for logging and configuration management.

6.1.8 Conclusion
QCraft's modular monolithic architecture is the optimal choice for this
desktop-based quantum computing platform. A modular monolith is a
single-deployment application with clear separation of concerns through
modular design, emphasizing well-structured internal architecture with
distinct modules.
This approach delivers the modularity benefits required for complex
quantum circuit processing while maintaining the performance, privacy,
and operational simplicity essential for a desktop quantum compiler. The
architecture supports future evolution to distributed services if
requirements change, while avoiding the premature complexity of
microservices for a single-user desktop application.

Assessment
QCraft employs a hybrid data persistence strategy that combines
multiple storage technologies optimized for different data types and access
patterns. Rather than relying on a single traditional database system, the
architecture uses specialized storage solutions tailored to the unique
requirements of quantum computing applications.

6.2.3.3 Partitioning Approach
For device-local storage with low writer concurrency and less than a
terabyte of content, SQLite is almost always a better solution. SQLite is fast
and reliable and it requires no configuration or maintenance. It keeps
things simple. SQLite "just works".
Logical Partitioning Strategy
Since SQLite operates as a single-file database, partitioning is
implemented through logical separation and table design:

6.2.8 Conclusion
QCraft's database design implements a hybrid storage architecture
optimized for desktop quantum computing applications. SQLite is often
used as the on-disk file format for desktop applications such as version
control systems, financial analysis tools, media cataloging and editing
suites, CAD packages, record keeping programs, and so forth. The
traditional File/Open operation calls sqlite3_open() to attach to the
database file. Updates happen automatically as application content is
revised so the File/Save menu option becomes superfluous. The
File/Save_As menu option can be implemented using the backup API. There
are many benefits to this approach, including improved performance,
reduced cost and complexity, and improved reliability.
The design prioritizes privacy, performance, and reliability through:
Local-only storage ensuring logical circuits never leave the desktop
environment
Multi-tier caching providing sub-millisecond access to frequently
used data
Automated backup and recovery ensuring data durability and
system resilience
Privacy-by-design with data classification and encryption controls
Performance optimization through indexing, batching, and
connection management

This architecture supports QCraft's core requirements while providing a
foundation for future scalability and feature enhancement.

6.3 INTEGRATION ARCHITECTURE
6.3.1 Integration Architecture Overview
QCraft's integration architecture is designed around a privacy-first,
desktop-centric model with selective external integrations for quantum
hardware execution. The system maintains strict boundaries between local
logical circuit processing and external quantum hardware access, ensuring
that sensitive quantum algorithms never leave the user's desktop
environment in unencrypted form.
Core Integration Principles:
Privacy Preservation: You must provide an IBM Cloud Identity and
Access Management (IAM) bearer token with every call as an http
header - all logical circuits remain local with only fault-tolerant,
encoded circuits transmitted externally
Hardware Agnostic: Unified abstraction layer supporting multiple
quantum platforms through standardized APIs
Asynchronous Processing: Non-blocking integration patterns for
quantum hardware execution with job queuing and status monitoring
Fault Tolerance: Robust error handling and automatic fallback
mechanisms for hardware unavailability

6.3.2 API DESIGN
6.3.2.1 Protocol Specifications
QCraft implements a multi-protocol integration strategy optimized for
different types of external interactions:

6.3.9 CONCLUSION
QCraft's integration architecture successfully balances the competing
requirements of privacy preservation, hardware accessibility, and
system reliability. The architecture ensures that logical quantum circuits
never leave the user's desktop environment while providing seamless
access to multiple quantum hardware providers through a unified, faulttolerant integration layer.
Key Architectural Achievements:
Privacy-First Design: All logical circuit processing remains local with
only encrypted, fault-tolerant circuits transmitted externally
Multi-Provider Support: Unified abstraction layer supporting IBM
Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) bearer token,
IONQ_API_KEY environment variable, JSON web token with sub or uid
claim, and AWS IAM authentication
Fault-Tolerant Integration: Comprehensive error handling with
automatic failover, circuit breaker patterns, and graceful degradation
Performance Optimization: Rate limiting with maximum rate
increase for adjustable quotas is 2X the specified default rate limit and
intelligent batching for optimal resource utilization
Monitoring and Observability: Real-time integration health
monitoring with automated alerting and performance metrics collection
The integration architecture provides a robust foundation for QCraft's
quantum computing platform while maintaining the strict privacy and

security requirements essential for sensitive quantum algorithm
development.

6.4 SECURITY ARCHITECTURE
6.4.1 Security Architecture Overview
QCraft's security architecture is designed around a privacy-first,
desktop-centric model that addresses the unique security challenges of
quantum computing applications while maintaining compatibility with
emerging post-quantum cryptographic standards. The architecture
recognizes that quantum computing technology is developing rapidly, and
some experts predict that a device with the capability to break current
encryption methods could appear within a decade, threatening the security
and privacy of individuals, organizations and entire nations.
Core Security Principles:
Privacy by Design: All logical quantum circuits remain within the
local desktop environment with no external transmission in
unencrypted form
Post-Quantum Readiness: Implementation of NIST's standardized
algorithms including CRYSTALS-Kyber, CRYSTALS-Dilithium, Sphincs+
and FALCON with instructions for incorporating them into products and
encryption systems
Defense in Depth: Multiple security layers protecting against both
classical and quantum-enabled threats
Zero Trust Architecture: No implicit trust for any component, with
continuous verification of all interactions
Security Context and Threat Landscape:
The quantum computing threat landscape requires immediate attention as
malicious actors are already stockpiling encrypted data in anticipation of
quantum breakthroughs that would render traditional encryption methods

obsolete. QCraft addresses this "harvest now, decrypt later" threat through
comprehensive privacy-preserving workflows and quantum-resistant
security measures.

6.5.2.5 Dashboard Design Architecture
Quantum Computing Dashboard Framework:
Following full-stack observability: Looking at just one piece of the puzzle
won't cut it—you need to be able to view your entire environment and all
dependencies through intuitive (and, ideally, customizable) dashboards to
understand how and why your IT environment functions as it does. This
comprehensive understanding will help you make more informed decisions
when it comes to application performance and resourcing. Such visibility
not only allows your teams to understand the full impact of proposed
decisions and move forward with confidence, but it democratizes the
monitoring and management process, allowing more teams to directly
access the information they need:

QCraft's monitoring and observability architecture provides comprehensive
visibility into quantum computing operations while maintaining strict
privacy controls and addressing the unique challenges of quantum threat
landscapes. The architecture successfully balances the need for detailed
system insights with the critical requirement to protect sensitive quantum
circuit data.
Key Monitoring Achievements:
Quantum-Aware Monitoring: Specialized metrics and alerts for
quantum circuit compilation, RL training, and QEC performance
Privacy-Preserving Observability: Complete system visibility
without exposing logical quantum circuits or sensitive algorithm data
Post-Quantum Security Monitoring: cryptographic observability, a
cryptographic inventory that allows stakeholders to monitor the
progress of adoption of PQC throughout your quantum-safe journey
Automated Incident Response: Intelligent alert routing and
automated resolution for quantum-specific issues
Comprehensive SLA Management: Quantum computing-specific
service level agreements with appropriate response times
The monitoring architecture ensures QCraft can operate reliably in
production environments while providing the observability needed to
optimize quantum computing performance and maintain security in the
face of evolving quantum threats. Piecemeal visibility needs to give way to
real-time observability – after all, you can't protect what you don't know is
exposed. The combined pressure of AI, expanding API ecosystems, and the
inevitability of quantum computing is forcing a reckoning in cybersecurity.
And for all of us to recognise that visibility and agility aren't just nice-tohaves anymore. They're the foundation of success in the new era.

6.6 TESTING STRATEGY

6.6.1 Testing Strategy Overview
QCraft requires a comprehensive, quantum-aware testing strategy
that addresses the unique challenges of testing quantum computing
applications while maintaining the privacy-first architecture. The fast pace
and domain-specific knowledge needed for quantum computing creates a
challenge for quantum software reliability that can sometimes only be
solved with attention to detail and lots of elbow grease. Making the
computation on the hardware reliable and keeping the effect of noise to a
minimum are certainly important milestones in unlocking the potential of
quantum computing, but less emphasis is usually put on the reliability of
the software stack.
Quantum-Specific Testing Challenges:
Probabilistic Nature: Traditional QA operates on deterministic
systems – given input X, you expect output Y. Quantum systems are
probabilistic by nature, meaning you might get output Y most of the
time, but sometimes you get Z.
Privacy Constraints: Logical quantum circuits must never be
exposed in test environments, requiring specialized testing approaches
Reinforcement Learning Complexity: Since the natural reward
structure is very sparse, the key to successful exploration in
reinforcement learning is reward augmentation.
Hardware Integration: Different quantum hardware (e.g.,
superconducting qubits vs. trapped ions) may behave differently. QA
should ensure software compatibility across platforms.
Testing Architecture Principles:
Privacy-Preserving Testing: All logical circuit data remains local with
no external exposure during testing
Quantum-Aware Validation: Statistical testing approaches for
probabilistic quantum outputs

6.6.2.2 Integration Testing
Service Integration Test Approach:
Integration testing for QCraft focuses on component interaction
validation while maintaining strict privacy boundaries. We showed that,
although the research community has started developing techniques to
test different parts of a QP, in practice, developers continue using classical
strategies to test quantum algorithms. Our results highlight the importance
of filling the gap between academia and practitioners in terms of the
testing strategies for QPs.

Quantum-Aware Testing: Quantum software testing := the activity
of testing the software used to convert quantum computations into
machine code executable on a quantum computer. Broadly it includes
both testing the quantum programs or algorithms, as well as platforms,
and in this blog post we will focus on testing quantum software
platforms.
Privacy-Preserving Validation: Complete testing coverage without
exposing logical quantum circuits to external systems
Multi-Layer Test Architecture: Unit, integration, and end-to-end
testing across the entire quantum computing stack
Automated Quality Gates: Comprehensive quality metrics with
quantum-specific performance thresholds
Cross-Platform Compatibility: Validation across Windows, macOS,
and Linux platforms with consistent PySide6 GUI behavior
The testing strategy ensures QCraft can deliver reliable quantum
computing capabilities while maintaining the privacy-first architecture
essential for sensitive quantum algorithm development. To remain relevant
and competitive, QA professionals must begin building foundational
knowledge in quantum computing. The QA landscape will soon demand
expertise that spans physics, cryptography, and advanced mathematics.

8. INFRASTRUCTURE
8.1 Infrastructure Architecture
Applicability Assessment
Detailed Infrastructure Architecture is not applicable for this
system due to the fundamental architectural design and deployment
model of QCraft.
QCraft is designed as a desktop-based, standalone quantum
computing application rather than a distributed cloud service or web
application. This architectural decision is driven by several critical factors
that make traditional infrastructure architecture inappropriate:

8.3 Conclusion
QCraft's infrastructure approach is optimized for desktop application
deployment rather than traditional cloud infrastructure. This design
choice aligns with the core privacy requirements and quantum computing
use case, where sensitive logical circuits must remain on local machines.
Key Infrastructure Achievements:
Minimal Infrastructure Footprint: Desktop-first architecture
eliminates need for complex cloud infrastructure
Cross-Platform Distribution: Native packaging for Windows, macOS,
and Linux with platform-specific optimizations
Privacy-Preserving Architecture: All sensitive quantum data
remains local with optional anonymized telemetry
Cost-Effective Deployment: Annual infrastructure costs under $3000
compared to tens of thousands for cloud services
Automated Build Pipeline: Comprehensive CI/CD pipeline for multiplatform builds and distribution
The infrastructure strategy successfully delivers a professional desktop
quantum computing platform while maintaining the privacy-first principles
essential for sensitive quantum algorithm development. This approach
provides users with complete control over their quantum circuits while
