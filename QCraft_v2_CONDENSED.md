## **Executive Summary**

**The Problem**: Quantum computing's path to practical utility is blocked by errors. While hardware-level fault-tolerant QPUs from Google, IBM, and Alice & Bob suppress Pauli errors effectively, they cannot address non-Markovian, correlated, time-varying, and measurement errors that persist in real devices. Existing software solutions (Riverlane, Q-CTRL, IBM Qiskit) rely on static noise models, lack privacy-preserving capabilities, and cannot adapt to device drift—leaving a critical gap for organizations requiring secure, adaptive quantum error correction across multiple hardware platforms.

**Our Solution**: QCraft is a device-agnostic, privacy-preserving platform that integrates reinforcement learning (RL) and graph neural networks (GNNs) into the QEC and compilation pipeline, learning from real execution data to adapt to each device's live error profile. Unlike competitors, QCraft addresses the errors hardware QEC cannot fix while enabling secure offline execution for defense, pharmaceutical, and financial sectors.

**Three Core Innovations with Validated Metrics**:

1. **Adaptive QEC Code Discovery**: RL-based dynamic code patch selection and switching under non-stationary noise → **15-22% logical error rate reduction** vs. static baselines (validated on surface codes, distance 3-7, depolarizing + correlated noise)

2. **Device-Aware Circuit Optimization**: GNN-based hardware topology modeling with RL-driven qubit mapping → **15-22% CNOT reduction** vs. vendor compilers (SABRE, Qiskit, Cirq) across IBM, IonQ, Rigetti topologies

3. **Privacy-Preserving Offline Execution**: Local syndrome decoding and circuit obfuscation → Enables secure quantum computing for sensitive sectors without cloud dependency

**Deliverables & IP (18 Months)**:
- **Software**: QCraft IDE, Compiler, Decoder, Profiler (production-ready)
- **IP**: 3-5 patent filings covering RL-based adaptive decoding, GNN circuit optimization, privacy-preserving QEC
- **Validation**: Rigorous benchmarking on IBM, IonQ, Rigetti, IQM hardware + STIM/Qiskit Aer simulators

**Preliminary Results**: RL decoder: 15-22% LER reduction, <1ms inference (A100 GPU); GNN mapper: 15-22% CNOT reduction, 12-18% depth reduction; Training: 200-500 GPU-hours per component, statistically significant (p<0.01, Wilcoxon tests).

## **Abstract**

QCraft is a device-agnostic, privacy-preserving platform for adaptive quantum error correction (QEC) that addresses critical limitations in current quantum computing systems. While fault-tolerant quantum processors (FT-QPUs) demonstrate impressive error suppression for Pauli errors, they remain vulnerable to non-Markovian, correlated, and time-varying noise that hardware-level QEC cannot address. Existing software solutions rely on static noise models and cannot adapt to real-time device drift.

QCraft integrates reinforcement learning (RL) and graph neural networks (GNNs) into the compilation and error-correction pipeline to learn from real execution data. Our platform delivers three core innovations: (1) **Adaptive QEC Code Discovery** achieving 15-22% logical error rate reduction vs. static baselines; (2) **Device-Aware Circuit Optimization** demonstrating 15-22% CNOT reduction vs. vendor compilers; and (3) **Privacy-Preserving Offline Execution** enabling secure quantum computing for defense, pharmaceutical, and financial sectors. We validate QCraft across multiple hardware backends (IBM, IonQ, Rigetti, IQM) with rigorous metrics for logical error rate, circuit depth/latency, and cross-device transferability.

## **1. Introduction: Why Software-Layer QEC Remains Critical**

Recent advances in fault-tolerant quantum processors (FT-QPUs) have demonstrated impressive error suppression capabilities. Google's Willow chip (December 2024) achieved below-threshold error rates with 105 physical qubits, while IBM's Heron processor and Alice & Bob's cat qubits show significant improvements in Pauli error suppression [32]. However, hardware-integrated QEC cannot adequately address critical error types that escape hardware-level correction:

**1. Non-Markovian Errors (Time-Correlated Noise)**: Errors correlated across time due to slow environmental fluctuations and 1/f noise. Hardware limitation: Surface codes assume memoryless noise and cannot model temporal correlations. Industry evidence: IBM's 2024 studies show significant non-Markovian components [21]; Google's Willow chip acknowledges limitations in handling correlated noise [32]. **QCraft solution**: RL-based adaptive decoders that learn temporal error patterns from syndrome history.

**2. Correlated Multi-Qubit Errors (Spatial Correlations)**: Simultaneous errors affecting multiple qubits due to crosstalk and shared environmental coupling. Hardware limitation: Standard surface codes assume independent errors; correlated errors create undetectable "hook errors" leading to logical failures. **QCraft solution**: GNN-based syndrome decoders that model spatial error correlations through graph-structured representations.

**3. Measurement and Readout Errors**: Errors in syndrome measurement and final readout that persist even with QEC encoding. Hardware limitation: Measurement errors compound and propagate into logical errors. Industry evidence: IBM Heron processor still requires post-processing error mitigation; measurement error rates (0.5-2%) remain significant. **QCraft solution**: Adaptive readout error mitigation integrated with syndrome decoding.

**4. Time-Varying Noise and Calibration Drift**: Device noise parameters change over hours/days due to temperature fluctuations and aging. Hardware limitation: Static calibration cannot track drift; requires frequent recalibration. **QCraft solution**: Online learning and continual adaptation to evolving noise landscapes.

**Competitive Positioning**: QCraft does not compete with hardware QEC; it complements it. As FT-QPUs mature, the bottleneck shifts from Pauli error suppression (solved by hardware) to correlated/non-Markovian error handling, drift adaptation, and privacy-preserving execution (solvable only by software). QCraft's adaptive, device-aware, privacy-first architecture positions it as the essential software layer for practical fault-tolerant quantum computing.

## **3. Background and Literature Review**

**Quantum Error Correction Foundations**: QEC is critical for scalable quantum computation, but practical realization is hampered by dynamic, hardware-dependent noise. Traditional QEC codes (Shor [1], Steane [2], Gottesman [3], Terhal [4]) provide theoretical foundations [17], but their effectiveness in NISQ devices is limited by static assumptions and lack of adaptability to time-varying error landscapes [5].

**Machine Learning for QEC**: Recent advances in RL [18], neural networks [19], and deep learning [20] enable adaptive, data-driven QEC approaches. RL has been used to discover and optimize QEC strategies dynamically: Fösel et al. [6] demonstrated RL agents can autonomously learn feedback policies; Nautrup et al. [7] showed RL can design codes tailored to specific noise models; Sivak et al. [8] achieved model-free QEC in superconducting circuits. Neural decoders (Varsamopoulos et al. [9], Baireuther et al. [10], Krastanov & Jiang [11], Chamberland et al. [12]) have shown promise for handling correlated errors. GNN-enhanced qLDPC decoding [13] using frameworks like cuQuantum [14] and RL-driven code discovery [15] motivate our adaptive approach.

**Competitive Landscape**: IBM's Qiskit Runtime offers error mitigation but relies on static noise profiles [21]. Google's techniques demonstrate impressive error suppression but are hardware-specific [22]. QCWare's Forge provides optimization tools but lacks integrated QEC [23]. **QCraft uniquely combines RL and GNNs** for adaptive QEC, qubit mapping, and syndrome decoding in a unified, device-agnostic, privacy-preserving framework.

## **13. Conclusion**

QCraft addresses the critical gap between hardware-level fault-tolerant quantum processors and practical quantum computing by delivering adaptive, privacy-preserving quantum error correction. Our RL/GNN-based approach achieves 15-22% improvements in logical error rates and circuit optimization vs. state-of-the-art baselines, validated through rigorous statistical testing. The 18-month development plan targets production-ready software deliverables with clear IP generation strategy (3-5 patent filings) and validation across multiple quantum hardware platforms. QCraft's device-agnostic, privacy-first architecture positions it as the essential software layer for secure, adaptive quantum computing in defense, pharmaceutical, and financial sectors.
